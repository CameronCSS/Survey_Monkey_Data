## About The Project

This project focused on refining a large dataset of survey responses from SurveyMonkey. The goal was to process and clean the data to deliver a structured and easily understandable format to the client.

### Key Aspects of the Project

- **Data Extraction and Transformation:** Utilized Excel to manipulate and link survey questions with their respective subquestions.
- **Data Cleaning:** Leveraged Python's `pandas` library within Jupyter notebooks to further clean and combine the data, transforming it into a more coherent structure.
- **Final Output:** Exported the cleaned data back into an Excel file for client delivery.

### Code Highlights

- Imported and processed the dataset using `pandas` and `openpyxl`.
- Employed data melting and grouping techniques to reorganize and analyze responses.
- Renamed columns for better clarity and exported the final dataset to a new Excel file.

Check out the Jupyter Notebook for details on the data processing steps.

## Usage

The data was processed with the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** Read and transformed the dataset using Excel and Python.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Applied `pandas` operations to clean and structure the data.
3. **Export:** Saved the cleaned data to an Excel file for final delivery.

To replicate this project, you will need:

- **Excel:** For initial data manipulation.
- **Python (`pandas` and `openpyxl`):** For data cleaning and export.

For further insights into `pandas` and data manipulation, explore the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [openpyxl documentation](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
